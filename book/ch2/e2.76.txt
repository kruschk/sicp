Explicit dispatch
When adding operations or types, new constructors and selectors must be
created, and care must be taken to ensure each representation uses unique
identifiers. Additionally, the generic interface procedures must be modified
so that they are aware of the new operations and types, and can dispatch
accordingly.

Data-directed
New operations are added by adding a new row to each table, which requires
modifying every package. Adding new types, on the other hand, does not
require changing other packages. To add a type, a new package is created,
with new constructors and selectors, but it is not necessary to ensure each
representation uses unique identifiers since the definitions are
encapsulated within the package. Data-directed style is ideal for a system
in which new types are added frequently.

Message-passing
New operations are created by defining a new generic procedure which returns
a procedure that checks which operand is passed to it and acts accordingly.
This makes adding operations straightforward, but adding a new type requires
every generic procedure to be modified. This style is ideal for a system
which requires new operations to be added often.
